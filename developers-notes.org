* Nifty tools 

*** Code Analysis 
This sections contains a description of different tools for code analysis, both advanced and simple tools

**** Source Code Line Counters 

In some cases it is nice to know how many lines of code and for this I have used to different tools [[https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/][SLOCCount]] and [[https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc][CLOC]]. 
At the moment of writing I use CLOC mostly as it is readily available on most major Linux distributions and MacOS and I have had few weird issues with SLOCCount. 
Both are able to provide a break down of the type of files in a project and give a total line copunt as well which is really nice, in particular if you are mixing languages with in a single project.
